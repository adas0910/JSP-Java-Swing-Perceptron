An implementation of logic gates with single layered perceptron in Java while implementing event handling as per project requirements. See [Note](#Note) below for further information.

## Installation

### Requirements:
* java 12.0.1 or higher
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 12.0.1+12) or higher
* Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 12.0.1+12, mixed mode, sharing) or higher

### Cloning:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/adas0910/JSP-Java-Swing-Perceptron.git
```

## Using JSP

1. Clone JSP to a local directory.

2. Compile the contents of src/main 
```sh
cd dir/JSP-Java-Swing-Program/src/main
dir/JSP-Java-Swing-Program/src/main>javac Driver.java Perceptron.java Truthtable.java
```

3. Provide the path for src/main to include the class files and compile the contents of src/gui 
```sh
cd dir/JSP-Java-Swing-Program/src/gui
dir/src/gui>javac -cp dir/JSP-Java-Swing-Program/src/main/ ConsoleOutput.java Mainform.java
```

4. Run Mainform to start the application
```sh
dir/JSP-Java-Swing-Program/src/gui>java -cp dir/JSP-Java-Swing-Program/src/main/; Mainform
```
